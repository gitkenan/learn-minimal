The authentication system in your app is built using Supabase Auth with the following key components and flows:

Authentication Context (AuthContext.js):
Provides global auth state management using React Context
Manages user session state and loading states
Handles session refresh and auth state changes
Exposes auth methods like signOut and refreshSession
Auth Component (Auth.js):
Implements the login/signup UI
Supports email/password and Google OAuth authentication
Handles auth errors and loading states
Redirects to callback URL after successful authentication
Auth Flow:
User initiates auth through Auth.js (email/password or Google)
On success, redirects to /auth/callback
Callback.js exchanges auth code for session
Session stored in localStorage and managed by AuthContext
AuthContext subscribes to auth state changes
API Protection (middleware.js):
Validates session for all /api/* routes
Refreshes session if needed
Adds auth token to API request headers
Returns 401 for unauthenticated requests
Security Features:
JWT-based session management
Secure cookie handling
OAuth state validation
Automatic session refresh
Protected API routes
The system uses modern auth patterns with Supabase handling the cryptographic operations while your app manages the auth state and user experience.
